    text: `        I'm a passionate athlete eager to make a difference in people's
  lives. I am currently attending post-secondary education at the
  University of Fraser Valley majoring in Kinesiology and minoring
  in Business Administration while working at Club 16 Trevor Linden
  Fitness in Coquitlam as a Senior Personal Trainer.
  <br />
  <br />
  â€‹After seeing close family members' physical capabilities
  depreciate over time, I strive to help anyone improve their
  physical fitness level with the end goal to improve their
  longevity, wellness, and decrease the effects of physical
  disorders. I strongly believe that anyone, regardless of age, can
  learn to adopt a healthier lifestyle.
  <br />
  <br />
  With over 12 years of combined bodybuilding, powerlifting, and
  sports conditioning experience I focus on helping my clients
  achieve their desired physique goals. Exercise not only helps
  improve one's physical health, but is a great way to relieve
  stress, improve self-confidence, and enhance the quality of life.
  My vision is to create a welcoming, comfortable, and
  non-judgmental atmosphere where you can unlock your physical
  potential. Striving to achieve your fitness goal is the stepping
  stone toward a healthier lifestyle.
  <br />
  <br />
  With my professional guidance and education, your goals are within
  arm's reach.`,
